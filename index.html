                    <p>The transition from basic notebook coding to data define programming has been fascinating in  equal measure.
                    I've learnt how to use data to gain insights that can assist in real-world situations.
                    During the period I spent as a trainee in NIIT I was trained in areas of Data wrangling, cleaning,
                    manipulation, visualization, piping, creating dashboards and modeling which are just a few of the skills
                    I gained at NIIT using platforms such as Excel, SSMS, Python, RStudio etc.</p>

            My role here was basic, if a customer is interested in analyzing data,
            as an analyst we were trained and equipped with the knowledge needed to
            gain necessary insight from the data. While I was undergoing training,
            I was also working at OXL media studios.</td>

                    Managing day to day accounting works in Ms365, Analysis & Analytics,
            campaigns ads, marketing, promotion and postal are proposed/designed,
            creating content for website optimization.  I worked at OXL while I was
            training to become an Analyst at NIIT.  Since the CRM was Excel, I did not have much problem
            applying what I learnt at NIIT It was a straight ball. This helped focus the media house at
            the right consumers by carrying out a basic survey.</td>
